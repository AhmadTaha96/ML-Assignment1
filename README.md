# ML-Assignment1

The data shall be read from the same directory on tasks files, I designed the solutions on Googel Coolab

The Repo contains 2 Notebooks:
We shoud run them by order First is regression notebook as we conducted the analysis of most of the features there then the classification notebook (the same order as in the assignment file), We start the analysis from Regression Task then we moved to Classification task, That it the classification task we have done depend on the regression task, kindly refer to it first then move on.

Project Report: Uploded to the Repo and can be found on the model.

### Data Files:
* bitrate_train (Train Data For Regression Task)
* bitrate_test (Test Data For Regression Task)
* train_data (Train Data For Classification Task)
* Test_data (Test Data For Classification Task)
